			<h1><center>TRANSPORTATION</center></h1>
			<div class="transpo">
				
				<div class="tran">
				<p><b><center>BY BUS</b>
				<br>There are buses and regular trips going to Cagayan 
				de Oro from Iligan City, Butuan, Balingoan, and Davao City. 
				We took a night bus coming from Davao and it took us 8-9 hours 
				to get to Cagayan de Oro. Read more here about our experience 
				in Samal Island Davao.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="tran">
				<p><center><b>BY SHIP/BOAT</b>
				<br>There are regular trips to and from Manila, Cebu, 
				Tagbilaran, Bacolod,Iloilo. The schedule and the trips 
				can be modified and cancelled because of weather conditions, 
				especially during rainy season.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="tran">
				<p><b><center>BY PLANE</b>
				<br>The easiest way to get to Cagayan de Oro is definitely 
				by plane. You can purchase cheaper flights online if you decide 
				to book usually 2-3 months before your planned date of visit, 
				go ahead and check out Cebu Pacific.  Also, the weather here can
				be a bit unpredictable. It could be boiling hot during the 
				summer, or too rainy around December to January. So it’s better 
				if you mentally prepare yourself ahead of time, unless those are 
				the type of climates you’re used to, then, welcome!</p>
				</div>

				<h3>TRANSPORTATION AROUND CAGAYAN DE ORO</h3>
				<p>Like any metropolitan in the Philippines, Cagayan 
				de Oro can be explored by riding jeepneys, buses and 
				taxis. Another convenient way of going around Cagayan
				de Oro is the multicab, a small truck that takes 
				passengers from specific routes much like a jeepney.
				You can also find vehicles similar to Thailand’s 
				tuk-tuk called motorella in Cagayan de Oro.
				<br>
				<br>
				When riding a taxi, make sure to find a driver that 
				will let you pay by the meter. Don’t try to negotiate 
				or agree with a price the driver dictates to avoid 
				getting ripped off. Jeepneys are much cheaper but may 
				be a bit challenging for some foreigners. However, 
				Cagayan de Oro is dubbed as “The City of Golden Friendship” 
				so talking to locals and asking about transportation routes 
				won’t be a problem.
